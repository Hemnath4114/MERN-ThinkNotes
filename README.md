# 🧠 ThinkNotes

**ThinkNotes** is a beginner-friendly full-stack note-taking web app built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes in a clean UI — no login needed. The app is built to **learn how frontend, backend, and deployment come together** in a real-world MERN project.
